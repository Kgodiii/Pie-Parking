# Overview of the Project

The Pie Parking App's primary objective is to streamline and automate the parking procedure.  
Users initiate a parking session by scanning a special QR code as soon as they arrive at the parking lot.  

They scan once more to conclude the session before departing; the system determines the length of time and final cost automatically.
